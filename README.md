This repo hosts a few of my projects related to the Fediverse client `pl-fe`. This includes:

- [pl-fe](./packages/pl-fe/) — a social networking client app forked from Soapbox
- [pl-api](./packages/pl-api) — a library for interacting with Mastodon API-compatible servers, focused on support for projects extending the official Mastodon API. It is used by `pl-fe`.

More projects to be announced.

Follow [my Pleroma account](https://pl.fediverse.pl/@mkljczk) to stay up to date on `pl-fe` development. You can also join the [project community on Discord](https://discord.gg/NCZZsqqgUH).


This project is tested with BrowserStack.
