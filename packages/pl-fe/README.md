`pl-fe` is a social networking client app. It works with any Mastodon API-compatible software, but it's focused on supporting alternative backends, like Pleroma or GoToSocial.

## Try it out

Want to test `pl-fe` with **any existing MastoAPI-compatible server?** Try [pl.mkljczk.pl](https://pl.mkljczk.pl) â€” enter your server's domain name to use `pl-fe` on any server!

If you want to use `pl-fe` as the default frontend on your server, download the latest build from [pl.mkljczk.pl/pl-fe.zip](http://pl.mkljczk.pl/pl-fe.zip) and install it following the instructions for your backend. For example, on a standard Pleroma installation you can use:

```sh
curl -O https://pl.mkljczk.pl/pl-fe.zip
unzip pl-fe.zip -d /opt/pleroma/instance/static/
rm pl-fe.zip
```
